"""Daily heartbeat to api.tesserae.ink.

A once-a-day, best-effort ping that reports low-cardinality, aggregate facts
about this install (version, release channel, platform family, deployment
kind, transport, a bucketed install age, the set of registered device kinds
with per-kind firmware / panel gamut / resolution / wake cadence, a bucketed
device count, a bucketed count of paired companion apps, a bucketed lineup
count, a handful of feature booleans, and a bucketed OTA rollout snapshot) so
the maintainer can see how many installs are active, what firmware and panels
are in the field, and what to prioritise.

Privacy: gated by the master online-features switch (nothing is sent when it's
off); no personal data, no exact device counts, no exact timestamps (the server
buckets to the day). The cadence is deliberately daily, with jitter, and
deduped on disk so a server that restarts many times a day still pings once.
See the privacy page for the exact payload.

Timing: the first heartbeat of an install's life goes out as soon as online
features are on (the wizard's "count me in", the Settings toggle, or the
first UI view), not after the daemon's boot delay. Short-lived trial installs
used to show up in the update check but never in the heartbeat, which skewed
the new-install and retention figures.
