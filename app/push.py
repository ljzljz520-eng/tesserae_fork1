"""Push pipeline: render → hand the composition PNG to every renderer →
write each artifact → publish.

Four entry points share the same single-flight + log-the-event tail:

* ``push(page_id)``, render a saved Page through the composer.
* ``push_image(image_bytes, source_label)``, hand arbitrary bytes
  directly to the renderers (Send-page file upload + image URL).
* ``push_webpage(url)``, screenshot an arbitrary URL via Playwright, then
  hand the bytes to the renderers (Send-page webpage tab).
* ``republish(event_id)``, re-publish a past push from history using the
  stored composition PNG, no re-render.

Concurrency: one push at a time, with latest-wins coalescing per
device (v0.69+). Callers wait on a shared ``_lock``; before waiting
they bump a per-device generation counter, and on lock acquire a
stale caller (its generation is no longer the latest for that
device) returns ``status="superseded"`` without firing so an already-
queued newer push wins. User-initiated pushes (Send-page,
test patterns, Push-now, republish) pass ``bypass_coalesce=True`` so
they always fire; scheduler / auto-refresh flows leave the flag
False so back-to-back schedule ticks don't paint twice. The old
``status="busy"`` drop path is retired.

The composition PNG is always written to ``data/core/renders/<comp_digest>.png``
as the canonical thumbnail. Per-renderer artifacts go to
``<digest>.<extension>`` next to it (content-addressed, so two renderers
producing identical output dedupe on disk).

Every push attempt, success, failure, or busy, is logged to
``EventLog`` so the Send-page history tab can list / resend / delete.

mypy --strict applies to this module, see pyproject.toml.
