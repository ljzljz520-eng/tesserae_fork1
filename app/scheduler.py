"""Background scheduler: the unified timed-content engine (#167 Phase 1).

Runs as a daemon thread (default tick 30 s). Each tick collects everything
due to fire, rotations (anchor-cycle step transitions), timer decks (the
same engine through an in-memory Rotation adapter), and schedules, into
ONE list sorted ascending by (priority, kind, id) and fires them in that
order. E-ink panels show the most recent frame, so the highest-priority
record fires last and wins the panel; equal priorities keep the historical
landing order (rotation, then deck, then schedule).

Schedule gating, by type:
   * **interval**, respects the day-of-week mask AND the time-of-day window
     AND the per-schedule cooldown (last_fired + interval_minutes)
   * **daily**  , respects the day-of-week mask, fires once per local day
     once the wall-clock time passes ``fires_at``. The first_seen guard
     suppresses backfill: enabling a 07:00 daily schedule at 11:00 doesn't
     fire today's missed 07:00, the next fire is tomorrow at 07:00.

last_fired + first_seen live in memory only. A restart resets both, which
means a freshly-restarted Tesserae may fire an interval schedule "early"
once and may skip a daily schedule whose target already passed today.
Persisting them is the obvious upgrade if either becomes a problem.

mypy --strict applies to this module, see pyproject.toml.
